1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create code.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit push before initializing dvc.
4. Now we do "dvc init" (create .dvcignore dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (create a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now will ask to do: (git rm -r --cached 'data' and git commit -m "stop tracking data")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then git add .gitignore data.dvc 
9. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again -- "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (We're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status everything is upto date
15. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data
